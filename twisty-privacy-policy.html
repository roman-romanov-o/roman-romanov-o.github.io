    <h1>TWISTY APP PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated April 5, 2024</em></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how TWISTY APP (“we,” or “us,” or
    “Developer”) collect, use and share personal information of users of the TWISTY mobile application (TWISTY or
    the “App”), website (the “Site”) and other services provided by the Developer (the App, the Site, and
    such services shall be collectively referred to as the “Service”). This Policy also applies to any of our
    other mobile applications or websites that post this Policy. This Policy does not apply to websites that
    post different statements.</p>
    <h2>WHAT WE COLLECT</h2>
    <p>We get information about you in a range of ways.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Information You Give Us. We collect information you directly give us, such as your voice recording when
    you engage with our pronunciation validation through the App (“Voice Recordings”), and your‎
    name,‎ email address,‎ phone number,‎ password, login credentials to your social network accounts, and
    demographic information. Please note that we only record Voice Recordings when you engage with our pronunciation validation through the App – we do not access the microphone of your device at any
    other time.
    </li>
    <li>Information That Is Aggregated. “Aggregate data” are data we collect about a group or category of
    features, services or individuals, from which individual identities have been removed. For example,
    information about how you use a feature may be collected and combined with information about how others
    use the same feature, without any personal information included in the resulting data.
    </li>
    <li>Information We Get from Others. We may get information about you from other sources. We may add this to
    information we get from the Service. We allow you to access third party services, such as Facebook and
    Twitter, to import information about who you are connected with on those other services so you can
    connect with them on the Service. Some of those third party services may also provide us with
    information from your accounts there to enhance and personalize your use of the Service; you may modify
    your privacy settings with those other services directly.
    </li>
    <li>Information Automatically Collected. We automatically log information about you and your computer. For
    example, when you visit TWISTY, we log‎ your computer operating system type,‎ browser type,‎ browser
    language,‎ pages you viewed,‎ how long you spent on a page,‎ access times,‎ Internet protocol (IP)
    address, and information about your use of and actions on TWISTY. We also collect (a) information stored
    in your phone, such as advertiser ID, phone brand and model, and default language, (b) your login
    information (either through email or Facebook), and (c) your approximate location (via IP address).
    </li>
    <li>Cookies. We may log information using "cookies" for the sole purpose of improving our Service.Cookies

    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>ADVERTISING AND REMARKETING</h2>
    <p>We may allow other companies, called third party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within
    the Site or the App. These third party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your
    browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Site. They automatically receive your IP Address
    when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to
    measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content. Further,
    these advertisers may also serve ads to you on other websites (including ads for our products and services)
    based on information collected from you while using the Site. For example, we may use Google’s “remarketing”
    service to target our ads to you based on your prior use of the Site or the App when you visit on other
    sites in Google’s content network.</p>
    <p>You should be aware that advertisers may target advertisements to users based on certain user
    characteristics. If you respond to this type of targeted advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may
    conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach. Our Privacy Policy does not
    apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such ad servers, ad networks, or their advertiser
    clients.</p>
    <h2>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h2>
    <p>The Site may contain links or references to external websites. These are provided for your convenience only,
    and we do not have control over the privacy or security practices and policies of third party sites. Any
    personal information you provide on linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to
    that third party's privacy policy. Please learn about the privacy and security practices and policies of
    external websites before providing them with personal information.</p>
    <h2>CHILDREN</h2>
    <p>Consistent with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we do not knowingly
    collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) without parental
    consent. Any person who provides their personal information to us through the Site represents that they are
    13 years of age or older. We ask for and store users’ date of birth to ensure they are 13 or older, but do
    not share that information unless the user chooses to share it on the user’s profile. If you believe that we
    have collected information from an individual under the age of 13, please contact us so that we may take
    appropriate steps to address the issue.</p>
    <h2>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>We take steps to help protect personal information. No company can fully prevent security risks, however.
    Mistakes may happen. Bad actors may defeat even the best safeguards.</p>
    <h2>TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES</h2>
    <p>Your personal information will be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States, and may in
    the future be transferred to, and stored and processed in, other countries. All transfers will either (a) be
    under the European Commission’s model contracts for the transfer of personal information to third countries,
    or (b) rely on the EU-US Privacy Shield framework.</p>
    <h2>CONTACT INFORMATION / DATA PROTECTION OFFICER</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, comments or complaints about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, or would
    like to exercise any of your rights and choices under this Privacy Policy or applicable law, you may contact
   the following email address: <a href="mailto:romanov.roman.65041@gmail.com">romanov.roman.65041@gmail.com</a>
    </p>
    <h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
    <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "updated date" on the
    Privacy Policy. For changes to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or
    disclosure of personal information that you have provided to us, the new policy will not apply to
    information collected prior to the change unless we obtain your consent. We encourage you to periodically
    review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect.
    Your continued use of the Service constitutes your going forward agreement to this Privacy Policy and any
    updates.</p>
