    <h1>TWISTY APP PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated April 9, 2024</em></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how TWISTY APP (“we,” or “us,” or
    “Developer”) collect, use and share personal information of users of the TWISTY mobile application (TWISTY or
    the “App”), website (the “Site”) and other services provided by the Developer (the App, the Site, and
    such services shall be collectively referred to as the “Service”). This Policy also applies to any of our
    other mobile applications or websites that post this Policy. This Policy does not apply to websites that
    post different statements.</p>
    <h2>WHAT WE COLLECT</h2>

    <li>Information You Give Us. We collect information you directly give us, such as your voice recording when
    you engage with our pronunciation validation through the App (“Voice Recordings”), and your‎
    name,‎ email address,‎ phone number,‎ password, login credentials to your social network accounts, and
    your musical playlist data (for example, your favourites tracks from Spotify, Youtube Music, Deezer, etc.), that cloud be directly shared on your permission. Please note that we only record Voice Recordings when you engage with our pronunciation validation through the App – we do not access the microphone of your device at any
    other time.
    </li>
    <li>Information That Is Aggregated. “Aggregate data” are data we collect about a group or category of
    features, services or individuals, from which individual identities have been removed. For example,
    information about how you use a feature may be collected and combined with information about how others
    use the same feature, without any personal information included in the resulting data.
    </li>
    <li>Information Automatically Collected. We automatically log information about you and your computer. For
    example, when you visit TWISTY, we log‎ your computer operating system type,‎ browser type,‎ browser
    language,‎ pages you viewed,‎ how long you spent on a page,‎ access times,‎ Internet protocol (IP)
    address, and information about your use of and actions on TWISTY. We also collect (a) information stored
    in your phone, such as advertiser ID, phone brand and model, and default language, (b) your login
    information (either through email or Facebook), and (c) your approximate location (via IP address).
    </li>
    <li>Public Content. You can contribute to the Service in a number of different ways that are intended to be
    viewed by other users, including writing reviews, uploading videos and photos, participating in forums,
    tagging products, filling out your public profile, and voting on other users’ contributions. We may
    store these contributions (your “Public Content”), display them to other users, and use them for
    promotional purposes. Note that if you include personally identifiable information in your Public
    Content, it can be used and viewed by others. We are not responsible for the information you choose to
